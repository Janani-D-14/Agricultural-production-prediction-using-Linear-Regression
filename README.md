# 🌾 Agriculture Production Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts agriculture crop production using historical data and a Linear Regression model.

## 📌 Project Objective
To forecast agricultural production based on previous years' crop data, helping in better planning and resource allocation.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Linear Regression model for prediction
- Visualizations of crop trends
- Model evaluation with R² score and RMSE

## 📁 Files Included
- `README.md` – Project documentation

## 📈 Output
- Line graph showing predicted vs actual crop production
- Printout of model accuracy and error metrics

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Run `agri_production.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook
